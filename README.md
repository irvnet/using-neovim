# Getting Started with Neovim and LazyVim for cloud-native working

This guide walks you through getting started with Neovim and LazyVim on MacOS. It assumes the reader is familiar with `vi/vim` and looking for a more modern experience working with cloud-native tooling and development. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Homebrew**: Used for installing dependencies.
- **Git**: For cloning and managing repositories.
- **A terminal emulator**: iTerm2 or even Terminal.app though, I'm partial to [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) these days personally

 We may need other tools, but we'll work through any additional requirements as necessary... Let's get started...
