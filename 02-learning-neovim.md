# Learning Neovim

## Why Switch to Neovim?

If you're comfortable with Vim but looking for modern enhancements, Neovim might be a great next step. Neovim builds on Vim's foundations by providing:
- **Improved Performance**: more responsive editing for large files.
- **Modern Features**: Native support for language servers, tree-sitter for syntax highlighting, and asynchronous plugins.
- **Better Defaults**: Seamless clipboard integration, true color support, and mouse support out of the box.

When combined with [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim), a curated configuration for Neovim, you get:
- **Preconfigured Plugins**: Ready-to-use tools for features like fuzzy finding, Git integration, debugging, and more.
- **Ease of Use**: A starting point for configuration with plenty of features, highly customizable, and easy to tweak for your needs.

## Getting Started: 

Learning Neovim can seem overwhelming, but starting with a step-by-step approach helps:

### **Step 1: Core Neovim Features**
- Use `:help` to explore Neovim's built-in documentation.
- Set up language servers (e.g., `pylsp` for Python or `rust-analyzer` for Rust) to enable IDE-like functionality.
- Experiment with tree-sitter for better syntax highlighting.

### **Step 2: LazyVim Enhancements**
- Learn the default keybindings (e.g., Space as the leader key) using the [LazyVim keymap guide](https://www.lazyvim.org/keymaps).
- Try out preconfigured plugins like [Telescope](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/telescope-nvim) for fuzzy finding and [Lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) for status lines.

### **Step 3: Expand with Plugins**
- Stick with LazyVim's defaults initially and add capabilities by exploring plugins on [Awesome Neovim](https://project-awesome.org/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim).

### **Step 4: Customize Neovim**
- Adjust LazyVim's configuration in `~/.config/nvim/` to add custom keybindings, autocommands, or plugin settings.
